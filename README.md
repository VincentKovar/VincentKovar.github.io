Hi there ðŸ‘‹
For more than 20 years, I have merged marketing, gaming, and customer education into powerful communications that equip and motivate players to make meaningful and measurable changes to their acquisition, onboarding, engagement, and retention. This experience spans industries but focuses on impactful adoption of emerging technologies. From the early Web to mobile, into the Cloud and onto the Web3; I take a sleeves-rolled up leadership approach that starts in the storm clouds of strategy and rains down into checklist tactics.

Okay, that last part sounded a bit dramatic but I wanted to demonstrate that I am a human writing this and not generative AI â€” assuming that I am not operating within some sort of Westworld/Battlestar Galactica scenario. Let's share a video interview, just to make sure.
